NetLogo's logging facility allows researchers to record student actions for
later analysis.

Logging in NetLogo is invisible to the student once initiated. The researcher
can choose the type of events logged through a configuration file.

NetLogo uses the log4j package for logging. If you have previous experience with
this package you'll find logging in NetLogo familiar.

[TOC]

## Starting logging

There is a NetLogo preference to enable logging:

- Open NetLogo, then open **Preferences** from the **Tools** menu.
- Check the box for **Enable Logging:** then click **OK**.
- Restart NetLogo and logging will be enabled.

The setting will remain in effect until it is unchecked and NetLogo is restarted again.

You can also specify the **Logging configuration file:** to use in the NetLogo **Preferences** as well.  If you leave
this value blank, then a default configuration file will be used (see below for more information).

### Starting with the command line

You can also enable logging and specify the configuration file to use by using a command line switch on Windows
and Linux.

Let's assume you are running on Linux and you have NetLogo installed in a `NetLogo 6.1.1` directory in your
home folder.  To enable logging, invoke the `NetLogo` executable like so:

    ~/NetLogo\ 6.1.1/NetLogo --logging ~/NetLogo\ 6.1.1/app/netlogo_logging.xml

You can replace the path to `netlogo_logging.xml` with any valid log4j XML configuration file (see below for more
information).

## Using logging

When NetLogo starts up it will ask for a user name. This name will appear in all
the logs generated during this session.

### Where logs are stored

Logs are stored in the OS-specific home directory. On most Unix-like systems
that is `/home/<username>/`.  On Windows the logs can be found in
`C:\Users\<username>\`, where `<username>` is the logged in user. On macOS the
usual location is `/Users/<username>/`.

There are two convenience commands that will help you manage the logs.
`__zip-log-files *filename*` will gather all the logs in the temp
directory and put them in one zip file, at the location specified. After doing
`__zip-log-files` the existing logs are **not** deleted, you can do so
explicitly by using `__delete-log-files`.

The following is a chart describing the name of the loggers available, the type
of events each logs, at what level, and provides a sample output using the
XMLLayout. All the loggers are found in `org.nlogo.log.Logger`. When referring
to the loggers in the configuration file you should use the fully qualified
name. So, for example, the logger `GLOBALS` would actually be
`org.nlogo.log.Logger.GLOBALS`

### How to configure the logging output

The default logging configuration (`netlogo_logging.xml`) looks something like
this:

NetLogo defines 8 loggers, all descend directly from the root logger, which
means unless you explicitly set the properties (appender, layout, and output
level) in the configuration they will inherit them from the root. In the default
configuration the root is set to level INFO, the appender is
`org.nlogo.log.XMLFileAppender` and layout is `org.nlogo.log.XMLLayout`.
Together these generate a nicely formatted XML file as defined in the
`netlogo_logging.dtd` which is based on the log4j dtd. If the appender is a
`FileAppender` (including the `XMLFileAppender`) a new file is start each time
the user opens a model.

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM "log4j.dtd">

    <log4j:configuration debug="false" xmlns:log4j='http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/'>

            <appender name="A1" class="org.nlogo.log.XMLFileAppender">
               <layout class="org.nlogo.log.XMLLayout"/>
            </appender>

            <category name="org.nlogo.log.Logger.WIDGETS">
              <priority value="off" />
            </category>

            <category name="org.nlogo.log.Logger.TURTLES">
              <priority value="off" />
            </category>

            <category name="org.nlogo.log.Logger.LINKS">
              <priority value="off" />
            </category>

            <root>
               <priority value ="info" />
               <appender-ref ref="A1" />
            </root>

    </log4j:configuration>

This configuration, first defines an appender named "A1" of type XMLFileAppender
with an XMLLayout. The appender defines where the logging data goes, in this
case the data goes into a file. In fact, if NetLogo is given a FileAppender it
will automatically start a new file every time the user opens a new model. The
XMLFileAppender also does some formatting and writes the appropriate headers to
the file. The layout defines how to write each individual message. Unless you
are an advanced user there is no need change (or worry about) the appender or
the layout.

At the end of the configuration notice the definition of the root logger. All of
the other loggers descend from the root logger and, thus, inherit the properties
of the root unless explicitly set. This case is fairly simple, having set up the
appender A1 we make that the default appender for the root (and all other
loggers) and make the default priority "INFO". Messages that are logged at the
INFO level or higher will be written, messages logged at lower levels will not.
Note that with only one exception NetLogo always logs at level INFO. Sets to
globals that don't change the value of the global are logged at level DEBUG.
Which means that these messages are disabled by default, since debug is lower
level than info. The rest of the body of the configuration file overrides
properties of the root logger in a few specific loggers (or categories as they
are known in the configuration file, the terms can be assumed to be synonymous
for the proposes of this document). That is it turns off the WIDGET, TURTLES,
and LINKS loggers, by default. To re-enable them you can changes the priority
from off to info, like this:

    <category name="org.nlogo.log.Logger.TURTLES">
      <priority value="info" />
    </category>

or you can simply remove the entire reference to the category from the
configuration file, as it is not serving any other purpose.

## Advanced Configuration

This is only a basic introduction to configuration files for logging in NetLogo.
There are many more configuration options available through the log4j framework.
See the [log4j documentation](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html).
